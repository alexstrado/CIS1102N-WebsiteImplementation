        <h1>Number Systems</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">When I was researching and writing down about number systems I learnt about new things and came to understand the mathematical complexity that is number systems. Number systems are ways for humans and computers to understand, store, and manipulate information. They aren’t just numbers but instead they are building blocks of digital computation that most systems use like decimals and binary they provide a way to express numbers digitally. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Exploring the different types of number systems were particularly interesting since I was always familiar with numbers but never what they were capable of doing but by understanding decimals, octal, and hexadecimals it made me realize what such simple numbers were so important in computers and electronics. Firstly Binary, with it being base 2 its the foundation of all digital devices while octal and hexadecimal are a more compact representation of complex binary structures. Base 2 structures are the fundamental structures for all electronic devices using only 0s and 1s to represent electrical current in circuits. Base 8 and 16 however were used to make binary numbers easier to read for humans for example in programming and data representation. For example hexadecimal is used in low level programming, color codes, and memory addresses.
</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Number Systems hold heavy significance due to their relevance, like how decimals are super important in commerce and daily life although not seen or noticed by most people for example phones, computers, laptops, gaming consoles, and calculators; these devices use data that is processed and executed by binary. These devices process inputs and then runs graphics or stored memory back to the user. Some other devices like wifi use these number systems in addressing systems through IPv4 and IPv6. In short, number systems are a secret invisible language that is basically used in almost every piece of technology out there.
