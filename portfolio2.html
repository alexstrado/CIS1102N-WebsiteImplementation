        <h1>Data, Information, and Information Systems</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">When I was doing research about the different topics; Data and Information, Information Systems, and the Different Types of Support Systems in Information Systems, it made me appreciate the importance of proper data management in any organization. Before this I always thought that data and information were essentially the same thing, but now I know that data is raw facts while information is processed, structured, and interpreted. The DIKW hierarchy helped me learn about how knowledge and wisdom comes from the same processed information and made me realize how important accuracy and context is in transforming raw data into information.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">While I was researching information systems it made me see the complexity behind technology we see for granted. It's not just computers its also how everything works together to collect, store, and distribute information. Information systems don't just depend on computers but also people, people are also needed to train the system or to fix data errors.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">About support systems within IS, like MIS, DSS, and Executive information systems there are some stuff that stood out to me. For example I realized how different system types have different purposes such as automating tasks to help managers make complex decisions. These decision support systems are interesting to me because they explore "what if" scenarios. The evolution of these systems into different systems such as in analysis, business, and artificial intelligence to provide more timely decisions.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In summary this research has helped me become more aware of the value of information and the different systems that support it. Especially with out I interact with data in my daily life whether it be in school, personal projects, or future potential work. Learning about these different concepts that I unknowingly rely on made me more thoughtful about how my data is being used and interpreted. This has given me more respect for the people in the field of information systems and how it plays a role in shaping how some organizations are operated.</p>
