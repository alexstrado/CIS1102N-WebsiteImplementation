        <h1>Computer Science as Discipline, Computing Disciplines and Majors</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">According to the information I have gathered and read from the different sources, studies, and reports; what stood out the most was the difference between traditional computing curriculum and actual real world skills that are needed to succeed in computer science. Students don't feel like they belong in the profession, and feel like we're just another cog in the machine instead of a dream that can become reality. The fire inside is slowly dying out as students slowly lose the passion that they first had when enrolling into computer science. When education feels like a fleeting wind instead of something that should be remembered and not forgotten, learning becomes a hassle and not something enjoyable. To counteract this, universities teaching computer science are making it more hands-on and giving real-world experience so that innovation doesn't get drowned down in a hopeless dream by a boring education system, this in turn also helps bridge the gap between knowing something in theory and practice.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In another sense whether you're learning or in healthcare, climate science, or AI ethics there are certain things that can't be solved alone and independently. Studies and reports show that computer science is not an isolated field but a collaborative field, since a single computer scientist wouldn't be able to do much without the help of other technical fields such as engineers, and humanities; as well as other curriculums that exist that share fields with computer scientists. Its also important to learn that it isn't just computer science and that other fields exist as well such as CS, IT, IS, CpE, SE, and other newer courses such as Data Science and Cybersecurity.The variety of courses show the richness there is in computer science, and the existence of institutions is to help guide students into what specific course interests them or is better suited for them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am Alex John K. Maestrado and ever since pre-school I've gone to the same school, Sacred Heart School Hijas De Jesus (SHS-HDJ), It is also the same school I graduated senior high from. I also have multiple first aid certificates from different organizations such as Red Cross, ERUF, and RAPID, although I'm only slightly active in the Red Cross since it was the first organization I received an SFAT certificate from. The reason I chose BSCS is because ever since I was in high school I was always interested in electronics both software and hardware. The only reason I chose BSCS instead of BSCpE was because I already somewhat knew how to disassemble, identify, and reassemble computers,laptops, and phones; so I chose BSCS. I never felt like BSCpE was my calling, even though I was more interested in the hardware instead of software in computer related things, and the pull I felt was always more into BSCS so I trusted myself and chose BSCS over BSCpE. Something I've also always always been told is, "Why not nursing or any other med-related field?" and the truth is, because it was never something I was really ever interested in. It was something I was roped into because my brother was also a member of RCY.</p>
